  <p class="Introduction">Once upon a time, a sailor and his ship got lost in an small island due to the strom</p>
  <Purpose></Purpose>
  <p class="Purpose">You must control the sailor to collect the falling stars as the source of energy for the stranded ship. Your goal is to successfully rescue the ship, get on, sailors!</p>
  <p class="Abstract">Abstract: </p>
  <p class="Context1">This is a simple game designed for gamers who like to play and complete tasks. The game takes place on an isolated island. Unfortunately, a crew and his ship are trapped here. The ship can only be exhausted in quantity, and the crew needs to find an alternative that can serve as the ship’s only quantity. Due to the special magnetic field of this small island, a strange astronomical phenomenon occurs. countless stars fall from the sky. These stars can just be supplied as energy to the ship. In this game, you can manipulate the crews to move right through the keyboard and try to collect the number of stars set by the goal. Judge whether the star is collected as a sign that the stars are hit by the crew before falling to the ground and disappearing. The level of brightness in the upper left corner of the game page increases as the number of stars you collect increases. As long as the sailor collects thirty stars, the stars stop falling. The ship can set sail!</p>
  <p class="Reflection">Reflection:</p>
  <p class="Context2"> Overall this is a game that is roughly made but still has highlights.<br> I am very happy with my graphic design for the whole program. It is innovative and coherent in terms of visual effects. In the method of collecting and calculating stars, I think I have used different methods and calculations very well. A more accurate final calculation was obtained. In terms of interaction, players can manipulate the sailor to achieve the game experience, which is also relatively successful. The falling stars can be accurately captured and counted I think also met my expectations. <br>But for this game, as peer students, the teacher, and the guest critic said there are many shortcomings and need to improve.
<br>The first is the lack of a game opening and a conspicuous game ending or hint of success. The second is that the screen gives a poor response when indicating that a star has been captured. Maybe I will try to indicate the captured status by changing the color of the star and hat. This can make the picture more vivid but also can provide players with a more direct and clearer gaming experience.  Then I would increase the movement of the ocean and get the water moving. Finally, after the successful capture, I should have let the sailor leave with the ship, rather than leaving the sailor to die alone on the island. In the future, I will explore more ways to calculate the distance of falling stars and sailors. For example, how to make the distance not a circle with all radii in effect but only the vertical distance. Also, I will explore how I can make the sailor keep moving when manipulated by the button and stop moving when not clicked, instead of needing to keep clicking the button. I also hope to add some sound effects to this project in the future to enhance its sensory experience. <br>
 Many thanks to Prof. Leon, fellows Sonny and Samantha, and LA Jessica for their support and assistance. Furthermore, I’d want to thank the references for inspiring me.
