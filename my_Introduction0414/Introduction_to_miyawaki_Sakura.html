    <h1>HER LIFE</h1>
    <p>Miyawaki Sakura, born March 19, 1998, better known mononymously as Sakura, is a Japanese singer and actress based in South Korea. She is a member of the South Korean girl group Le Sserafim. </p>
    <h2>OVERVIEW OF HER CAREER</h2>
    <p>Miyawaki began her music career with the girl group HKT48 in 2011, and was a concurrent member of their sister group AKB48 from 2014 to 2018.<br>
         During her tenure, she held center positions for the singles "Kimi wa Melody" and "No Way Man". Miyawaki took a hiatus from HKT48 in 2018 after placing second in the reality competition show Produce 48, joining the girl group Iz*One until 2021.</p>
    <h3>SHINGING POINTS ON HER</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A quote:<br>
            "Cooking is not feminine, it is human. 
            Cooking and cleaning is something anyone can do,
             not just for women."</li>
        <li>An impression of her:
            As for the lady, she was smiling the whole time she was talking.
             She encouraged us while we were crying. 
             We were there to deliver energy, but instead, 
             were the ones who got to smile. 
        </li>
        <li>A difficulty she met:<br>
            “After “Produce 48” ended, I had to debut right 
            away despite not knowing a thing about Korean. I 
            could only say greetings and thanks, and didn’t 
            even understand what the mentors were saying. I 
            could not understand the lyrics, so I had to use 
            a dictionary all the time. Variety show appearances
             were also tough, as I could not get what people were
              saying nor why they were laughing, and could only mimic them.” 
        </li>
    </ul>
